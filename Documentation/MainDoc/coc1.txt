Documentation
-Started documentation
-found arduino frequency libary
-fft, fun times
-installed arduinofft by enrique condes
-frequency calculation for lowpass
-human ear can hear from 20hz to 20kHz
-for now gonna work with up to 900 -1kHz as led flashing any brighter than that seems unreasonable
-chose 4x10 ohm resitors in paraless with 4.7m√ºF fg = 846...Hz
-built lowpass, works perfectly, but will be interesting to see whta happens to high pitch songs, as high frequencys get compresst
-changed frequency badn now with a resolution of 128 samples making 64 bands
-20 bands per colour
